# resmethods

This is the source code of the website for the research methods modules that form part of the University of Lincoln's MSc programmes in Psychology

The website is created in RMarkdown using the `distill` package. The slides are created using `xaringan`, with some additional help from `xaringanExtra`, `xaringanThemer`, and `xaringanBuilder`.

# Keeping your analyses organised

You ran an experiment. 

You downloaded the data.

You wrote an Rmarkdown document to process the data and run your analysis.

You wrote your report based on that output.

Where do you put all of this?

# RStudio Projects

On RStudio.cloud, each project you create is in fact a completely separate instance of R

For working on your own projects (e.g. your dissertation) I recommend that you download and install [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Once that's up and running, you can get to grips with [RStudio projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) 

Projects provide a neat way to organise your work into neat, individually tailored sets of directories.

# Keeping your analyses organised

Make a new RStudio project for each separate "project" - one for your thesis, one for you assessment, and so on.

Follow sensible structure:

Keep your data in a folder called data.

Keep your scripts in a folder called scripts.

[Give your files sensible names!](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)

# Watch the workflow demos!

On Panopto you'll find a couple of videos for this week that demonstrate some aspects of this process.

1) A demo of processing the raw data from the Fear of Crime study

2) A demo of processing the raw data from a study of mental rotation.

These videos are *largely improvised*, far from exhaustive, and may occasionally be confusing when I become confused!

# Create slides

All of the R based lectures are created using RMarkdown and the [`xaringan`](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/) package.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width= 300, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/blob/master/PNG/xaringan.png?raw=true")
```

# Create websites and blogs

The course website was created using the `distill` package.  

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width= 300, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/distill/master/man/figures/logo.png")
